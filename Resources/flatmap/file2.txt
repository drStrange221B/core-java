Our assignments will usually say "create a text file". It may be for an input data file, it might be an output capture file, it might be a design for a program, it might be a test plan.

Hint: if you are using Windows, set the Folder Properties so that you can see the file extensions. It makes it much easier to understand!

How do you create a text file? There are several ways:

The editor in your IDE will do fine. The thing to remember is that you want to save the file with an extension that is NOT .py, if the file does not contain Python code. Must the extension be .txt? not necessarily, but it is very common for text files to have that extension.
Notepad is an editor that will create text files. It is located in "All Programs", under "Accessories" on a Windows machine.
There are other editors that will also work. Be aware of the format of the file you are saving - usually there is a box that gives you a choice.
Microsoft Word CAN create a text file, but you MUST save it correctly. You must choose the "Save as Type" of Plain Text (*.txt). If you use the default type, you get a DOC file. It is NOT sufficient in Word just to type in a filename of "myfile.txt" in the Save window. If the TYPE of the file is not set correctly (i.e, to "Plain Text"), this will create a file named "myfile.txt.doc", which is still a doc file!
WordPad will save a text file, but again, the default type is RTF (Rich Text). This is NOT a text file! Try to load an RTF file into Notepad and you will see all the other data in there.
